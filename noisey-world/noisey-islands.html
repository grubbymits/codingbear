            Procedurally generated 2D islands, written in Go.<br><br>
          My first attempt at a procedurally generated was just some brute
          force thing that I created for Dungen. What I really wanted to do
          was to try to create a outside world - I find those types of games
          far more appealing. I quickly stumbled upon the procedural generation
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/"> sub</a> and,
          like every other noob, got excited about Perlin noise.<br><br>
          I wanted to restrict myself to a 2D world and create something that
          looks something like the glorious British Isles: Scotland and Suffolk
          in particular... I took some resources from Kenney, made a load
          of modifications, and read through Amit Patel's
          <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/">
          tutorial</a>. Making a 2D map with different 'heights' is something
  	  that I've never concerned myself with before. But I can remember the
	  joy of Zelda and Pokemon on the GameBoy - so the map is
	  constructed to look like those games: terraces where the character
	  would traverse them from the side facing the player.<br><br>
          The Source code is on
          <a href="https://github.com/grubbymits/noisey-world">github</a>
          <br><br>
	  I quite like Go, for me it feels like scripting with C.
	  It was useful to have standard library for image manipulation and
	  though Go is designed for concurrency, it wasn't difficult to run
	  multiple threads across multiple cores simultaneously too. The
	  drawbacks, similar to C, are having to write boiler code for anything
	  algorithmic! Package management is also a bit odd... but it seems both
	  dependencies and generics are something that are being addressed. I
	  really don't understand how/why these were overlooked before. Or why
	  the official compiler doesn't make use of GCC or LLVM...<br><br>
