        By day, Sam works as a compiler engineer at Arm. By night he's
        generally lazy, playing games and watching netflix, but sometimes
        he does some game programming. Any fruits of that labour is held here.
        He likes cooking, music, plants and being outside. He also doesn't
        mind his wife too much either.<br><br>

          Red Blob Games</a>
          A truly great resource for anyone wanting to learn some algorithms and
          techniques useful in 2D game development. The site contains many
          iteractive demos and example implementations - I can't recommend it
          enough.

          Game Patterns</a>
          Bob Nystrom wrote a great book, 'Game Programming Patterns', and, of
          course, he has a blog which often also covers game programming.
          I really enjoy his writing style.

          <a style="font-size:medium" href='dungen/start.html'>Dungen</a>
           is a work in progress to create a 2D turn-based dungeon crawling
          fantasy RPG, written in Javascript. The player selects a character
          and then the area in which to play - with different areas that
          contain different types of enemy.
          There are multiple areas, with each area containing multiple levels
          which increase in difficulty.
          The player will build up a party of
          characters to defeat the dungeon, collecting loot from chests on the
          way. The equipment system is a bit of a mess though!
          The game engine is relatively complete, but it's visuals are lacking.
          'stand out' features are procedurally generated maps, with local
          storage to save progress between sessions.
          The game has a basic battle and magic system, with different playable
          characters; though the enemy details need to be filled out.
          It should also be updated to use web workers to cache resources.

            A simple shoot-up 'em that started as a project to teach da yoot
            Javascript. A simple game which partitions the screen in columns and
            injects enenmy spaceships into them, with only one ship per column.
            The enemy ships travel from the top of the screen to the bottom and
            randomly shoot lasers. The player controls a ship located at the
            bottom of the screen and has to prevent the enemy ships from passing
            it. All of the resources are by Kenney, linked above.
